          Currently working as Product Owner for 2 Squads for Safeco/Liberty Mutual. One squad’s mission is to re-platform the rules engine from 1980’s to scope business rules and provide cloud enablement. The 2nd squad’s mission is to implement

          National Flood Services (NFS) is a business unit within Aon which deals with Flood Insurance. NFS does complete servicing of flood insurance policies for WYO carriers from quote, issuance of policies, claims management, agency management
          and transactions. NFS sells two types of flood insurance policies for WYO carriers. One type of flood insurance adheres to National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP) regulated by Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA). The other type of
          flood insurance are the Private Flood insurance policies from WYO carriers. I was the PM for rolling out extensive features for their product called FloodPro & FloodDirect.

          Project: Map Analyst Application (Liberty Mutual)
          <br><br>
          Business wanted to redesign their Map Analyst tool which is the key proprietary tool for estimating the Catastrophe (CAT) for a given address in risk prone states before accepting the quote by the company. I invested this idea to the
          application owner and it was most welcomed and hence, we rebuilt this tool by implementing hazard maps, territory maps, Zip & County files from census.gov, Shoreline maps, Tax maps etc to Google Maps API. This ended becoming an outstanding
          tool for Underwriters and Territory managers in analyzing the risks. We also pulled the policy and agency information and populated on the Google map. When the user scrolls on the map, in the back-end, SQL query will run on the fly to
          populate the agency and policy data on the map.

          <br><br>
          Client wanted to decrease the quoting time for the field users since the volume of business were rapidly increasing. Hence, several thought process were put together such as automated quoting techniques, getting the prior carrier details
          from agencies in the form of ACORD, defaulting policy attributes complying with state regulations etc, and decreased the per quote time from 13 minutes to 6 minutes which increased the quote issuance rate massively. I also use SQL to write
          queries that serves business reporting on the fly. Book Transfer ended up generating 20% of total business to client.
